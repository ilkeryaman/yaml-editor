# YAML Editor

This is an example project that parses yaml content to GUI (TreeView nodes) for helping automation teams to avoid human errors. By using YAML Editor, yaml content can be edited via GUI and exported to a new yaml file.

It makes IP/email validations, as well as checking references between ip blocks.
